"""Gate: the inference server accepts connections as soon as it is BOUND, before
it serves — so `mill start` no longer refuses connections while the model loads.
`pixi run test-server-bind`. Pure CPU (loopback sockets), no GPU / weights.

server.mojo's main() binds + listen()s up front, THEN loads weights, THEN serve()s;
a client that connects during the ~10-15s load is completed by the kernel into the
listen backlog instead of getting ConnectionRefused (its request just waits until
accept() runs). This pins that property: a bound, not-yet-accepting TcpListener
still completes client connects — exactly what HttpServer.bind() relies on.
